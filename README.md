# Don't Sleep

_The Unity game that won the "Best in Show" award at CodeDay Seattle (Winter 2017.)_

"Count sheeps till you fall asleep," they said. Well, sleep is for the weak. You will throw pillows at all the sheeps that make you sleepy and eat all the candies that keep you awake. The screen dims in proportion to your sleepiness. Good luck.

# DontSleep

A Unity game which won the "Best in Show" award at CodeDay Seattle (Winter 2017.)

Plot:
-----------
"Count sheeps till you fall asleep," they say? Well, you will destroy as many sheeps as you can to stay awake. Collect pillows to throw at the sheeps and candies to keep yourself awake. Each time a sheep hits you, you become sleepier. Good luck not falling asleep as the screen dims in proportion to your awakeness bar.

Hi recruiters! Please try not to judge. We both know Hackathons only exist to teach everyone tape-and-glue programming. Oh, and free food. FREE FOOD!?
